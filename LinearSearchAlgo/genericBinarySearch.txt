********************************** GENERIC BINARY SEARCH **********************************

The algorithm or the code which we have written for binary search is for that particular problem. But we need to write a generic algorithm
for binary search for all the problems.
    1. Come up with the possible conditions to check whether the position is lying in the list and its limits.
    2. Retrieve the mid point. i.e find the middle element of the list.
    3. If middle element equals to the query number than return its position
    4. If answer lies before it than, repeat in the first half of the list.
    5. If answer lies after it than, repeat in the second half of the list.

Generic Binary Search Funtion =====>>>>>

def binary_search(low, high, condition):
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        result = condition(mid)
        if result == 'found':
            return mid
        elif result == 'left':
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return -1
